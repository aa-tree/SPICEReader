state		Get state of bodies in the ephemeris.
			State is return in form of a vector, containing 3 components of
			position [KM] , and 3 components of velocity [KM/S]. 

			Case 1: For a single body.
			Required Arguments:
			-body 				Name of the body for which state vector is required. 
			-obs 				Name of the observing body. 
			-time 				Time at which state vector is required.
				--format  		Format of time. Could be:
								(a) EPH - Ephemeris time. Seconds after J2000.
								(b) JULIAN - Julian date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
			output				Only if the output is required to be written to a file. 
				-file			Path to output file.
				
			
			Case 2: Batch processing.
			-input 				Path to the input file. 
								Input file must be a CSV of the format:
								[BODY],[OBS]
								E.g.: 
								Jupiter, Earth
								Moon, Earth
								 
							 
			-time 				Time at which state vector is required.
				--format  		Format of time. Could be:
								(a) EPH - Ephemeris time. Seconds after J2000.
								(b) JULIAN - Julian date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
			output				Only if the output is required to be written to a file. 
				-file			Path to output file.
				
			
Argument Examples
1) State of Jupiter w.r.t Earth at a particular date:
		state -body Jupiter -obs Earth -time --format JULIAN 2019-01-01 12:31:22 output -file temp/test.out

2) State of bodies in a batch:
		state -input temp/input.dat -time --format JULIAN 2019-01-01 12:31:22 output -file temp/test.out
