state		Get state of bodies in the ephemeris.
			State is return in form of a vector, containing 3 components of
			position [KM] , and 3 components of velocity [KM/S]. 

			Case 1: For a single body.
			Required Arguments:
			-body 				Name of the body for which state vector is required. 
			-obs 				Name of the observing body. 
			-time 				Time at which state vector is required.
				--format  		Format of time. Could be:
								(a) EPH - Ephemeris time. Seconds after J2000.
								(b) JULIAN - Julian date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
			output				Only if the output is required to be written to a file. 
				-file			Path to output file.
				
			
			Case 2: Batch processing.
			-input 				Path to the input file. 
								Input file must be a CSV of the format:
								[BODY],[OBS]
								E.g.: 
								Jupiter, Earth
								Moon, Earth
								 
							 
			-time 				Time at which state vector is required.
				--format  		Format of time. Could be:
								(a) EPH - Ephemeris time. Seconds after J2000.
								(b) JULIAN - Julian date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
			output				Only if the output is required to be written to a file. 
				-file			Path to output file.
				
			
						Argument Examples
						1) State of Jupiter w.r.t Earth at a particular date:
								state -body Jupiter -obs Earth -time --format JULIAN 2019-01-01 12:31:22 output -file temp/test.out
						
						2) State of bodies in a batch:
								state -input temp/input.dat -time --format JULIAN 2019-01-01 12:31:22 output -file temp/test.out
						

time 		Convert between time formats [Ephemeris time and Julian Date]

		-convert 				Input that you want to convert. Value could be Julian date or seconds
								past J2000. 
									a) In case you provide ephemeris time, the unit is in seconds, and 
									   the output will be in format:
								   					"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
				   					b) In case you provide Julian date, the preferred format would be:"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
				   					   and the output will be in ephemeris time [seconds]. 
									
						Argument Examples
						1) time -convert 120202
						
						2) time - convert 2019-03-01 22:33:33,4443

search		Search if a body is present in the epheremis.

						Argument Example
						1) search Jupiter
						2) search Io
